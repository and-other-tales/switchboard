# OpenAI Realtime API with Twilio Quickstart

Combine OpenAI's Realtime API and Twilio's phone calling capability to build an AI calling assistant.

## Quick Setup

Open two terminal windows:

| Terminal | Purpose                       | Quick Reference (see below for more) |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1        | To run the `webapp`           | `npm run dev`                        |
| 2        | To run the `websocket-server` | `npm run dev`                        |

Make sure all required environment variables are set or add them to `webapp/.env` and `websocket-server/.env`. Required variables:
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` and `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` for the webapp
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `PUBLIC_URL` for the websocket-server

See [full setup](#full-setup) section for more.

## Overview

This repo implements a phone calling assistant with the Realtime API and Twilio, and had two main parts: the `webapp`, and the `websocket-server`.

1. `webapp`: NextJS app to serve as a frontend for call configuration and transcripts
2. `websocket-server`: Express backend that handles connection from Twilio, connects it to the Realtime API, and forwards messages to the frontend

Twilio uses TwiML (a form of XML) to specify how to handle a phone call. When a call comes in we tell Twilio to start a bi-directional stream to our backend, where we forward messages between the call and the Realtime API. (`{{WS_URL}}` is replaced with our websocket endpoint.)

```xml
<!-- TwiML to start a bi-directional stream-->

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Say>Connected</Say>
  <Connect>
    <Stream url="{{WS_URL}}" />
  </Connect>
  <Say>Disconnected</Say>
</Response>
```

### Life of a phone call

Setup

1. The application is deployed to a publicly accessible URL (Cloud Run)
2. We set the Twilio webhook to our Cloud Run service URL
3. Frontend connects to the backend (`wss://[your_backend]/logs`), ready for a call

Call

1. Call is placed to Twilio-managed number
1. Twilio queries the webhook (`http://[your_backend]/twiml`) for TwiML instructions
1. Twilio opens a bi-directional stream to the backend (`wss://[your_backend]/call`)
1. The backend connects to the Realtime API, and starts forwarding messages:
   - between Twilio and the Realtime API
   - between the frontend and the Realtime API

### Function Calling

This demo mocks out function calls so you can provide sample responses. In reality you could handle the function call, execute some code, and then supply the response back to the model.

## Full Setup

1. Make sure your [auth & env](#detailed-auth--env) is configured correctly.

2. Run webapp.

```shell
cd webapp
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Run websocket server.

```shell
cd websocket-server
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Detailed Auth & Env

### OpenAI & Twilio

Set your credentials in `webapp/.env` and `websocket-server` - see `webapp/.env.example` and `websocket-server.env.example` for reference.

### Public URL

Twilio needs to be able to reach your server through a public URL. When deployed to Google Cloud Run, your application will be accessible through a public URL provided by Cloud Run.

Set the `PUBLIC_URL` environment variable to your Cloud Run service URL. This will be used by the websocket server to determine the correct WebSocket URL to provide to Twilio.

The application is configured to run on port `8080` on Cloud Run by default.

# Additional Notes

This repo isn't polished, and the security practices leave some to be desired. Please only use this as reference, and make sure to audit your app with security and engineering before deploying!
